# Brain MRI Image Segmentation
## 🏆 Winner Of The 2021 Imperial College Data Science Challenge


In the [2021 Data Science Institute Computer Vision Challenge](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/),  we applied semantic image segmentation techniques on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to aid the diagnosis of brain tumors. [Prof. Yike Guo](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.guo), the co-director of the Data Science Institute (DSI), and the DSI judging panel awarded this work as the winner of **"Best Computer Vision Project"**. Since our model achieved the highest dice score (78%) in the testing tasks, which uses U-Net architecture with pre-trained VGG16, and was trained on 90% of the available data.

<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: About The Project</h2>

**To provide solutions for real-world applications**, I further developed it into a **Tumor Segmentation API** that could be accessed by **doctors and clinicians for effective screening and diagnosis**.

## Dataset
The dataset of brain MRIs from patients with glioma, MRI images are on the left and on the right are corresponding masks which have been annotated by the doctor. The dataset can be downloaded from Google Drive [URL](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y4MUrrfT-Xuos83nOnq8ZWTMZmp9qADH?usp=sharing).

## 🎯 RoadMap
### Model Training

0. Upload `Dataset` to Google Drive, dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y4MUrrfT-Xuos83nOnq8ZWTMZmp9qADH?usp=sharing).
---
1. (Optional) Create an account on [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) platform (The training is tracked by `wandb`, this is a tool for tracking and visualising machine learning experiments in real time. If you have an account on Weights & Biases, get started by copying the profile API key and pasting it later in the notebook as requested) 
---
2. Open [notebook](./notebooks/TumorSeg_Winner_U_Net_VGG16.ipynb) in Google Colab to train U-Net model
---
###  API Development 

3. Clone this repository, open a terminal and navigate to the directory to write the command

    `git clone https://github.com/xy2119/Brain_MRI_Image_Segmentation.git` 
    
    `cd Brain_MRI_Image_Segmentation`
---
4. Create and set up the environment `tumorseg`

   `conda create --name tumorseg --file requirements.txt`
---
5. Activate `tumorseg` environment 

    `conda activate tumorseg`
    
---
6. Move trained model to the current directory. 
   
   You are welcomed to deploy your own model, or download mine :) [unet_vgg19.h5](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TElZ-XPhn0Vc41nLx2NJMYaR8CSbhbB1/view?usp=sharing)  <-  testset dice score~81% trained from [here](./notebooks/TumorSeg_API_U_Net_VGG19.ipynb)
---
8. Run `api.py` script and visit the web address to try out the segmenting functions!
    `python api.py`

---

## Future Work
Exploring more advanced segmentation models, including SEP and FCBFormer on the leaderboard of paperwithcode.
